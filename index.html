        <div class="subtitle">a 2-Minute Read</div>

        <p> Hello. Thank you for arriving here. This page is written and maintained entirely by myself, for my personal
            sharing purpose only. I guarantee that it is free of hatred of any kind. The sole purpose of this page is 
            to spread the awareness of the Nanjing Massacre outside Chinese-speaking communities. May we remember the 
            history and slaughters don't take place again.
        </p>
