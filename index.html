    <h1>The Nanjing Massacre During WW2</h1>

    <!-- Intro -->
    <p class="lead"> Hello. Thank you for opening this page. My name is Xiaoxuan. I’m a Chinese living in Australia. 
    </p>
  
    <p class="lead"> This page is written and maintained entirely by myself, for my personal sharing purpose only.  
          The sole purpose of this page is to introduce the Nanjing Massacre outside Chinese-speaking 
          communities. May we remember the history and the world be free of slaughters.

    <h2>What is the Nanjing Massacre?</h2>

    <p> The Nanjing Massacre was a brutal slaughter of Chinese cilivians in 1937 by the Imperial Japanese 
        Army in the city of Nanjing, then the capital of China. Japan invaded China in 1931, and in 
        December 1937, the Japanese Army captured Nanjing city. The Massacre started on December 13 and 
        lasted for six weeks. Massive murders and rapes were commited, and about 300,000 people were 
        tortured to death. In some literature, the incident is referred to as “the Rape of Nanking”, 
        Nanking being the former English spelling of the city name.</p>
    
    <p> The incident took place in 1937, but I used “during WW2” in the title, which may cause controversy 
        since it’s widely known that WW2 started in 1939 and ended in 1945. Here’s my brief explanation: 
        The war in which the Nanjing Massacre took place did not end until September 2, 1945, when Japan 
        surrended unconditionally and WW2 came to an end. More importantly, at the same time Japan invaded 
        not only China but several countries. Therefore I think it is legitimately part of World War 2. 
        I honestly don’t see any reason why not.</p>
