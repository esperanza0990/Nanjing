    <h1>The Nanjing Massacre During WW2</h1>

    <!-- Intro -->
    <p class="lead"> Hello. Thank you for opening this page. 
    </p>
  
    <p class="lead"> This page is written and maintained entirely by myself, for my personal sharing purpose only.  
          The sole purpose of this page is to introduce the Nanjing Massacre outside Chinese-speaking 
          communities. May we remember the history and the world be free of slaughters.
    </p>

    <!-- Part 1 -->
    <h2>What is the Nanjing Massacre?</h2>

    <p class="lead"> The Nanjing Massacre was a brutal slaughter of Chinese cilivians in 1937 by the Imperial Japanese 
        Army in the city of Nanjing, then the capital of China. Japan invaded China in 1931, and in 
        December 1937, the Japanese Army occupied Nanjing city. The Massacre started on December 13 and 
        lasted for six weeks. Mass murder and mass rape were commited, and about 300,000 people were 
        tortured to death. In some literature, the incident is referred to as “the Rape of Nanking”, 
        Nanking being the former English spelling of the city name.</p>
    
    <p class="lead"> The incident took place in 1937, but I used “during WW2” in the title, which may cause controversy 
        since it’s widely known that WW2 started in 1939 and ended in 1945. Here’s my brief explanation: 
        The war in which the Nanjing Massacre took place did not end until September 2, 1945, when Japan 
        surrendered unconditionally and WW2 came to an end. More importantly, at the same time Japan invaded 
        not only China but several countries. Therefore I think it is legitimately part of World War 2. 
        I honestly don’t see any reason why not.</p>
    
    <!-- Part 2 -->
    <h2>Remembrance</h2>

    <p class="lead"> Chinese people take the Nanjing Massacre very seriously. It is equivalent to 9/11 attacks to Americans. 
        December 13 is the Nanjing Massacre National Memorial Day. The city of Nanjing rings sirens, and memorial activities take 
        place across the country.</p>

    <p class="lead"> We will also remember John Rabe, a businessman from Germany, who helped to 
        establish the Nanking Safety Zone, which sheltered 
        approximately 200,000 Chinese people from slaughter during the Massacre.</p>

    <p class="lead"> We commemorate this Massacre, to remind ourselves that the peace we have today should not be taken 
        for granted, and to deliver the message that none should suffer from such inhumane violence. </p>

    <!-- Part 3 -->
    <h2>Do I Hate Japan? No.</h2>

    <p class="lead"> Very certainly no. I know Japan very well, I have been there, I have friends living in Japan, and I 
        admire Japan for many of its achievements. I sincerely wish China and Japan be in good relation. But 
        I will never forget what the Japanese Army did in 1937.</p>

    <!-- Part 4 -->
    <h2>More Info</h2>

    <p class="lead"> If you want to know more, please Google it. There is plenty of reliable information regarding 
      this incident in academia and in general public. </p>

    <p class="lead"> I highly recommend this 13-minute WW2 video 
      (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q78COTwT7nE&list=PLBDA2E52FB1EF80C9&index=38">YouTube link</a>) 
        from Crash Course. It is not specifically about the 
        Nanjing Massacre, but it devotes a considerable part to WW2 outside Europe and presents a very global view 
        of this World War. The Nanjing Massacre is mentioned at 1:33 as the Rape of Nanking.</p>
