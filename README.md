## The Nanjing Massacre During WW2

Hello. Thank you for opening this page! My name is Xiaoxuan. I’m a Chinese living in Australia. 

This page is written and maintained entirely by myself, for my personal sharing purpose only. I guarantee that it is free of hatred of any kind. The sole purpose of this page is to spread the awareness of the Nanjing Massacre outside Chinese-speaking communities. May we remember the history and the world be free of slaughters.

### What is the Nanjing Massacre?
The Nanjing Massacre was a horrific slaughter of Chinese cilivians in 1937 by the Imperial Japanese Army in the city of Nanjing, then the capital of China. It started on December 13, 1937 and lasted for six weeks. Massive murders and rapes were commited, and the crimes were unbelievably brutal. There is no official statistics, but the number of victims is estimated to be around 300,000.

The incident took place in 1937, but I used “during WW2” in the title, which may cause controversy since it’s widely known that WW2 started in 1939 and ended in 1945. Here’s my brief explanation: in the English-speaking world, the war in which the Nanjing Massacre took place was commonly called “the Second Sino-Japanese War”. But that is literally the same war (look it up!) that ended when Japan surrendered on September 2, 1945. Therefore I think it is legitimately part of World War 2. I honestly don’t see any reason why not.

### In Memory of Our People
Chinese people take this incident extremely seriously. 

December 13 is the National Memorial Day in China. In the city of Nanjing, alarms are run every year to remind people of the brutal slaughter.

The narratives of the survivors can be easily found in Chinese, but rarely translated into other languages.

Chinese people are grateful to Mr. Hinkerman, a German business man who provided shelters for the civilians.
