# Project Nanjing: The Nanjing Massacre During WW2

I made this project to learn the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework. I am exploring frontend web technologies this week, having a lot of fun.

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is a simple frontend web development toolkit. It is easy to manage and it's incredibly powerful. In this project I did not use the JS components of Bootstrap. I used the Cover example template provided on the official site.

This project is a static page displaying an article I wrote about the Nanjing Massacre, which took place in 1937. The page is published at https://esperanza0990.github.io/Project-Nanjing.

This project is named after Nanjing (南京), the former capital of China and in which the Nanjing Massacre took place. It is my habit to name all my programming projects after Chinese cities (sometimes provinces and prefectures).
